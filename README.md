## ☁️ Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### Cloud Models

| Model         | Description | Advantages | Considerations |
|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Private Cloud** | Infrastructure exclusive to one organization. Can be hosted locally or on a private space in a public cloud (e.g., Azure VNet). | Maximum control, higher security, compliance with internal policies. | Costly, less scalable, maintenance responsibility. |
| **Public Cloud** | Services provided over the internet by third-party providers like Azure, AWS, GCP. | Cost-effective, global scalability, managed infrastructure. | Shared responsibility for security, vendor lock-in. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Combines private and public infrastructure for flexibility. | Data residency control, scalable resources, optimized costs. | Complexity in integration, consistent governance needed. |

### Consumption-Based Model

- Azure uses a **pay-as-you-go** model (OpEx).
- Eliminates upfront investments (CapEx).
- **Scales with demand**, reducing waste.
- Enables **financial predictability** via autoscaling and budgeting tools.
